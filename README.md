# About GraphicsSandbox

GraphicsSandbox is an attempt to make a C++ graphics engine powered by OpenGL that runs on both Mac and Windows. The Windows version is built with Visual Studios 2013 and the Mac version is built with Xcode 8.

The system is mostly based off tutorials provided by [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com).
